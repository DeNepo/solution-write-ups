# [challengeName](link-to-challenge)

<!--
  describe the function's behavior in your own words.
  explain why someone might want to use this function
-->

## Syntax

> functionName(`type`, `type`, ...) -> `type`

### Parameters

**paramName**: `paramType`

<!--
  describe the parameter
-->

### Return Value: `type`

<!--
  describe the return value
-->

## Test Cases

<!--
  copy in the test cases from the original challenge

  if you write your own test cases in a sandbox file, include those too
-->

## Use Cases

<!--
  write a minimum of 2 use cases to show this functions behavior.

  try to find interesting _edge cases_, it's good for you ;)
  an edge case is when a function behaves different than you'd expect.
  This will help you and others better understand the function.

### Strategy

<!--
  Describe what strategy they used to pass this challenge.
  Careful! your strategy description should not mention
    the code they wrote to solve the challenge.

  Practice describing their strategy at a higher level:
  a simple way to understand strategy is to think of the important steps
  between the argument values and the return values.

  For example if they use a `for` loop
  you won't mention that `i` was incremented,
  but you might mention how the final result changes at each iteration.
-->

### Implementation

<!--
  Describe the solution written by this user.
  How did they use JS to implement their strategy?
  What language features did they use?
  What decisions do you think they made and why?
-->

### Possible Refactors

<!--
  List a couple changes you could make in their code without changing their strategy.
  For example:
    `while` loops and `for` loops can often be interchanged.
    `if else`, `switch case` and `_ ? _ : _` can sometimes be interchanged.

  You don't need to actually rewrite the function.
  The goal of this section is that you exploring different JS language features
  and think of different ways to implement the same strategy.

## Retrospective

<!--
  write any notes to help you review this exercise later, and to help others' study it.

  this might include:

  - good ideas to use later in your own code
  - less good ideas to avoid in your own code
  - new vocabulary you learned
  - the most important thing(s) you learned
  - something that you still don't understand but want to keep studying
  - something that surprised you
  - tricks you will want to remember and use later
